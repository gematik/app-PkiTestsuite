# Release notes PKI Test Suite

## Release 2.2.0

- add tests for admission and profession oid's for test object types that have to evaluate roles
- BUGFIX: prevent checkInitialState from passing when performInitialState is not true
- BUGFIX: initialTslAndTa.sh from failing
- change shell skripts to return correct error code
- update dependencies

## Release 2.1.0

- API CHANGE: introduce test object type. Instead of choosing the right certificate path for a test
  object, it is now possible to use a parameter (`testObjectType`) instead. (one of:
  IntermediaerServer, KimFachdienst, VsdmFachdienst, VpnKonzentrator, VpnRegServer, IdpFachdienst) (
  see section [configuration](./README.md#configuration) in readme)
- change behaviour of test case `verifyExpiredTslInSystem()` to allow a test object to invalidate
  the trust store immediately after expiration of the TSL
- NEW test case: `verifyUseCaseRsaCertValid()` which uses a RSA certificate for the use case
- NEW test cases: check hash algorithm in OCSP context
- BUGFIX: correct extension oid in TSL services
- BUGFIX: prevent possibility to write unsigned TSL to out directory
- change communication between test suite and simulators to json (instead of java serialization)
- remove config parameter: `tslSettings.initialStateTslImport`
- remove unused test data for checks of keyUsage and extendedKeyUsage; we do not check for these
  errors
- correct and update AFO annotations
- establish swagger api documentation in server simulators at: `http://server:port/api-docs`
- javadoc is not generated anymore
- change OCSP responder to actually calculate issuerCertHash and issuerKeyHash instead of mirroring
  the request
- optimize execution time of parameterized tests by skipping initial state for the non-first test
  cases
- add gematik security policy
- refactor code for better readability and consolidate certificate constants
- increase code coverage
- update dependencies

## Release 2.0.0 - Beryllium

- API CHANGE: rename some test cases, so old and new [allTests.txt](./allTests.txt) are incompatible
- API CHANGE: restructure pkits.yml so old config files are incompatible
  (see: [all parameters](./docs/all_pkits_parameters.yml) for more info)
- BUGFIX: repair broken test data certificates
- BUGFIX: do not execute remaining tests if a trust anchor test case failed
- BUGFIX: change ocsp request handling in verifyOcspResponseTimeoutAndDelay
- NEW test case: verifyOcspRequestStructure
- NEW test case: verifyUseCaseCertsNotInTsl
- NEW test case: verify critical extensions in certificates
- NEW test case: verifyExpiredTslInSystem. ATTENTION: this test case is executed at the end. The
  test object has to be reinitialized with a new trust space afterward, because its trust space
  is not valid anymore.
- introduce allFailed.txt to execute all failed tests quick & easy (
  see [readme](./README.md#selecting-specific-tests))
- prevent startup of PcapManager, OCSP and TSL simulators during initalTslandTa execution
- restructure the order of topics in the test report
- OCPS Responder and TSL Provider are started only once for each run
- update docker files for use with the latest docker version
- add possibility to change log level over *.sh scripts
- stabilise some test cases with rare race conditions (i.e., verifyUseBackupTslDownload,
  verifyRetryFailingTslDownload, verifyIrregularDifferencesBetweenCurrentAndNewTsls)
- increase code coverage
- restructure code for better readability
- update dependencies

## Release 1.1.3

- BUGFIX: in mechanism of test selection in allTests.txt
- do not execute checkInitialState more than once
- remove example yaml from config dir, this file should not be used in own test and lead to
  confusion
- generate test data (TSLs) on-fly (instead of reading manually prepared TSL XML templates)
- add some more test cases for deeper TSL testing
- add helper scripts and documentation for running OCSP- and TSL simulator in docker containers
- add possibility to execute scripts on remote servers via ssh
- update dependencies
- refactoring and optimizations

- add test cases in the context of Trust Anchor Change verificationâ€”the tests are set to run as
  the last
- add test cases in the context of TSL signer certificate verification
- add test cases in the context of TSL approval verification
- force trust anchor change tests to run as last
- add documentation of all AFOs and corresponding test cases
  files: [AFOs description](./docs/afoCoverage_afoDescriptions.txt),
  [AFOs to tests mapping](./docs/afoCoverage_afoToTests.txt),
  [tests to AFOs mapping](./docs/afoCoverage_testToAfos.txt)

  externally (not by the test
  suite)

  file: [all parameters](./docs/all_pkits_parameters.yml)
- annotate test cases with corresponding AFOs
